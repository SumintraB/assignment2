2\. From the command line interface, initialise this folder as a git repository and push it to the GitHub classroom repository.

-   **Open your terminal** and change into the project directory.\
    cd documents/assignment2

-   **Initialize a Git repository** in the current folder. This sets up version control for your project\
    git init

-   **Create a *.gitignore*** **file** and ***add .Rproj.user/*** to exclude unnecessary RStudio project files from being tracked.

-   **Stage all project files** for commit.\
    git add .

-   **Commit the changes** with a clear message describing what was done\
    git commit -m "created a new project and qmd file"

-   **On GitHub**, create a new repository manually. Make sure **not to include** a **README, .gitignore, or license**.

-   **Copy the repositoryâ€™s SSH URL** from GitHub.

-   **Link the local repository to the remote GitHub repository**:\
    git remote add origin git\@github.com:your-username/your-repository.git

-   **Push your local repository to GitHub**.\
    git push -u origin main

3\. Create a new branch called testbranch. Modify the file example.qmd and add the changes to both the local and remote repositories.

-   **Create and switch to a new branch called *testbranch***\
    git branch testbranch - creates a new branch named testbranch\
    git switch testbranch -switch to created branch

-   **Modify the example.qmd**

-   **Stage all the files**\
    git add .
